# File Naming App

This app can be used to either, select from a file explorer, or, drag and drop one or multiple files and prepend them with a descriptor. It will also create a folder to store the groups in. **This utility will NOT edit the original files**. I advise checking to make sure the prepended files are not corrupted before erasing original files. After filling out the form and selecting the photos simply click Submit. Go to the uploads directory of this project and verify that all of your files are there and that they are not corrupted. After verifying it is important that you **refresh** your browser to avoid buggy behavior.
